## What Are They?

A `service` in ROS2 is a structured message type that defines a `request` data type, and a `return` data type. Is is contained in an `.srv` file with the following structure:
```
# Request
datatype request_name
---
# Response
datatype response_name
```
This defines how a client node can communicate with a service node. The client makes a request of the specified data type. The server does something with that information, and returns the eponse data type.

A `service` differs from the `publisher` and `subscriber` paradigm in that the latter is suited to streaming data. A publisher node will make data publicly available on the ROS2 network that any number of subscribers may access and make use of. In contrast, a service is a direction communication between the server and client.

We can think of the publisher and subscriber model like a newsagency, where different magazines and journals are made publicly available that customers can subscribe to based on relevant interests.

The service and client model is more like sending a letter directly to someone, who will then write back directly to you with the requested information.

## 1. Writing a Service Node

:rotating_light: As a prerquisite, make sure you have created and compiled the [tutorial_service_definition](https://github.com/Woolfrey/tutorial_service_definition) package. :rotating_light:

i) Navigate to your ROS2 workspace source folder and create the new package:
```
cd ~/<workspace_director>/src
ros2 pkg create --dependencies rclcpp tutorial_service_definition -- tutorial_service_client
```
ii) Navigate in to the newly created package and create the `haiku_server.cpp` file:
```
cd tutorial_service_client/src
gedit haiku_server.cpp
```
(You can use whatever IDE you like, besides `gedit`).

iii) Insert the following code in to the file and save:
```
[WORK IN PROGRESS!!!]
```
iv) Go back and add the following to the `CMakeLists.txt` file before the `ament_package()` line:
```
```
v) Edit the `package.xml` file with the following:
```
```
vi) Navigate back to the root of your ROS2 workspace and compile the package:
```
cd ~/<workspace_director>
colcon build --packages-select tutorial_service_definition
```
